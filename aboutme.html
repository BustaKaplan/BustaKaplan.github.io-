      <h4>CoderGirl</strong></h4>
        <p>
        I am studying wed development through LaunchCode's 1 year
        CoderGirl cohort, and am absolutely loving it. I am constantly surrounded by
        so many strong and smart women. I feel very fortunate that I was accepted
        into the program

    <div class= "element mint"> <h4>Logistics</h4>
    <p> Since graduating from the University of Missouri, I have worked for three
    years in the transportation industry. One year as an Operations Supervisor for ABF
  Freight, and another two years working as an Operations Specialist at Echo Logistics.
These experiences have given me invaluable problem solving and leadership experience.</p> </div>
