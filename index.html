        I am a Chicago transplant and University of Missouri Graduate living in Saint
        Louis. I am an animal lover and frequently volunteer and foster with Stray Rescue
        of St. Louis. I love being active outside and can frequently be found hiking, biking,
        or canoeing across Missouri's beautiful landscape. I am currently learning CSS/HTML5
        and JavaScript through CoderGirl's year long cohort.
